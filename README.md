# Mouse Using Eye 🎯

A Python-based project that uses eye-tracking technology to control mouse movements. This innovative solution enables hands-free interaction with your computer, leveraging OpenCV and advanced computer vision techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- Control mouse movements using eye gestures.
- Hands-free interaction for accessibility and convenience.
- Customizable parameters for sensitivity and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing and eye tracking.
- **Dlib**: For facial landmarks detection (optional but recommended).
- **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating mouse movements.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
1. Python installed on your system.
2. Necessary libraries installed (see Installation section).

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mouse-Using-Eye.git
   cd Mouse-Using-Eye
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python dlib pyautogui numpy
   ```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python eye_mouse_control.py
   ```

2. Follow on-screen instructions to calibrate the eye tracking.

3. Start controlling the mouse using your eyes!
